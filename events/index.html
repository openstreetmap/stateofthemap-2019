        <p>Talks and workshops are not the only important part of the State of the Map conference, making new contacts and friends is also a huge part. So what better way to Bridge the Map than to join us on the social events that are being organised. </p>

          <h2 id='icebreaker'>Ice Breaker</h2>
          <p>On Friday <span class="numeral">20</span> September at <span class="numeral">18:00</span> we will hold an icebreaker get-together at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1539908487" target="_blank">Marstall Cafe</a> in the Altstadt of Heidelberg. This get-together allows you to meet new people or to catch up with old friends that you may not have seen since the last time you were at a SotM conference. It is run on an informal basis, in that there won't be any set agenda, but there will be members of the local team there and so you can ask us any questions you have.</p>
          <p>Running alongside this icebreaker, we are also planning a small gathering targetted at those people from the academic community, especially PhD students. It is in the same location as the icebreaker get-together, but a bit separated so that there is a bit more space to discuss things that academics like to discuss. This is a great opportunity to start networking with fellow PhD students and colleagues from all around the world who share the same interests, and maybe even working in similar fields.</p>
          <p>There is a bus stop outside the venue (Marstallstraße) which can be used to get to the venue directly from near the conference venue (Technologiepark or Bunsengymnasium) using the number <span class="numeral">31</span> bus (roughly every 10 minutes). There are also a number of buses from the Bismarckplatz hub which travel via the Marstallstraße stop including the <span class="numeral">35</span>, <span class="numeral">32</span>A, and <span class="numeral">735</span>. Please not that due to construction works at Heidelberg main station (Hauptbahnhof) the connections are subject to change. You can check for the latest information at the <a href="https://www.vrn.de/index.html" target="_blank">VRN website</a>.</p>
          
          <h2 id='main-social-dinner'>Main Social Dinner</h2>
          <p>This years main social event takes place on Saturday <span class="numeral">21</span> September in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4359648634" target="_blank">HebelHalle</a> in Heidelberg. Aswell as having food provided by <a href="https://www.sindbad-gastronomie.de/" target="_blank">Sindbad</a> catering, there will be the annual OSM awards, and plenty of opportunity to have some drinks, celebrate and dance the evening away. More details will follow shortly...</p>
          <p>Directly outside of the HebelHalle is a tram and bus stop called Rudolf-Diesel-Straße for the number <span class="numeral">26</span> tram (towards Kirchheim Friedhof) and <span class="numeral">33</span> bus (towards Emmertsgrund). The 26 tram comes directly from the Bismarckplatz hub and so the venue is easily reachable from anywhere in Heidelberg. Please not that due to construction works at Heidelberg main station (Hauptbahnhof) the connections are subject to change.

          <p>On Sunday <span class="numeral">22</span> September in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5762624" target="_blank">Mathematikon Building</a> we will host this years poster session, where you can see the posters that have been selected for display this year and talk to the authors. There topics on display will be as varied as the talks given during the day, and so there is sure to be something of interest for everyone. And to help sliding into discussion easier, we are pleased to announce that we will be offering some very special beer at this event, brewed here in Heidelberg especially for the SotM conference.</p>

            <p>As well as the conference itself and social events that are held during it, there is also the opportunity to attend some other events in Heidelberg that may be of interest to attendees of the conference.</p>
            <h2 class="space-bottom" id="tardur-workshop">Workshop on time-restricted routing</h2>
            <p>Before the State of the Map conference kicks off, there is a workshop taking place at Heidelberg University about using temporal restrictions in route calculations. This workshop runs all day on Friday <span class="numeral">20</span>th September in the Geography department of University Heidelberg.</p>
            
            <p>Registration to the event is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSci2wsKftTzxWOBqtc-0GY_UY52YJBssLdbMvU6YdR1gfy8ug/viewform" target="_blank">here</a> and details are as follows:</p>
            <p>Date: <span class="numeral">20</span> September, <span class="numeral">9:00 - 16:00</span> (Friday before SotM)<br/>
                Location: Room <span class="numeral">013</span>, Im Neuenheimer Feld <span class="numeral">368</span>, Heidelberg<br/>
                Contact: <a href="mailto:andrzej@openrouteservice.org">andrzej@openrouteservice.org</a></p>

            <p>We are delighted to invite you to join a workshop on open-source routing with time-dependent restrictions, see <a href="https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/tardur.html" target="_blank">https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/tardur.html</a></p>

            <p>The workshop will give you the chance to get a behind the scenes view of routing with temporal road restrictions such as nightly driving bans for trucks, one-way streets alternating between the directions and winter barriers in mountains. Technical challenges will be discussed based on the open-source solutions from GraphHopper and OpenRouteService which both rely on the open-access OpenStreetMap road network. Apart from an introduction to the TARDUR project you will have the unique opportunity to present your work and get in touch with other people considering applying time-dependent constraints in their projects.</p>

            <p>Detailed programme will be announced closer to the event date.</p>

            <p>Registration deadline: <span class="numeral">31</span>st August.</p>
