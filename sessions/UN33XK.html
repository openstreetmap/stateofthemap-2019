<p>The talk would go over tips for mappers to help them think through potential license issues for imports. The tips would cover all the major steps for determining compatibility: identifying the data's license, check OSM-related history, identifying/resolving compatibility issues, and achieving community consensus. 
This talk will be useful for any mapper with compatibility questions or who is interested in importing open data into OSM. </p>
<p>Outline:
- Sources of information about the license
  - Website (page from which data is downloaded, about page, FAQ, TOS)
  - Accompanying file (e.g., README, LICENSE)

  - Metadata
- Information about licenses/dataset previously evaluated for use with OSM
  - Imports wiki page
