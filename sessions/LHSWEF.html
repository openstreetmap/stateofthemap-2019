<p>What does it take to build a new generation of mappers ready to solve challenges within their
community? It starts by amplifying the voices of youth, giving them the tools and opportunities
they need to learn GIS mapping and understand how they can apply it to their everyday life. It
continues by intentionally creating spaces for youth to engage in local and international mapping
initiatives.</p>
<p>This presentation will feature students from YouthMappers chapters throughout the world
sharing how they are building a sustainable, inclusive mapping community at their university
and beyond. Each YouthMappers student will spotlight a mapping initiative they are driving or
contributing to, sharing their process for deciding what issues to map, engaging and training
new mappers, especially women, and using map data to advocate for change in their local and
global communities. Learn how you can plan your next mapping initiative with youth at the
forefront.</p>
<p>YouthMappers is an international university consortium on Mapping for Resilience. The
consortium organizes a global community of learners, researchers, educators, and scholars to
create and use open geographic data that directly address locally defined development
challenges worldwide. YouthMappers’ mission is to cultivate a generation of young leaders to
create resilient communities and to define their world by mapping it. We are supported by
funding from the US Agency for International Development, our founding universities, and other
private donors and partners</p>
