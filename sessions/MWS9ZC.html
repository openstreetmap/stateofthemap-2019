<p>This study examines OpenStreetMap data quality at different stages of a participatory mapping process developed for understanding inequalities in healthcare access of informal urban residents in Africa and Asia. Recent studies have examined quality intrinsically and extrinsically. However, in both cases, the data production processes are often not completely transparent to researchers, therefore limiting possibilities for systematic data quality analysis of the processes leading to OpenStreetMap update.</p>
