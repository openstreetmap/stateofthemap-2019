The program will allow attendants to present and learn about latest developments in OpenStreetMap in presentations, lightning talks as well as workshops and birds of a feather sessions. Additionally, for the second time, State of the Map will host a parallel Academic Track to showcase scientific contributions on OSM.

We are looking forward to further designing our program with you and welcome your thoughts and ideas. If you are interested in joining the program committee or if you have any suggestions, please feel free to <a href="mailto:sotm@openstreetmap.org">get in touch with us</a>.
