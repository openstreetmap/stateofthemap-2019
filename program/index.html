<p>State of the Map 2019 is taking place from <b>21 to 23 September 2019</b> in Heidelberg, Germany. We have created an exciting program with youâ€”the OpenStreetMap community. For the duration of the conference, we have rooms set aside for breakout sessions that can be booked by groups of mutual interest, or used without prior planning.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#general_Saturday">Saturday, 21 September</a>: conference begins with an opening session, followed by a day of presentations and workshops</li>
  <li><a href="#general_Sunday">Sunday, 22 September</a>: day 2 of more presentations and workshops plus a whole track of <a href="../academic_programme/">academic talks</a> selected by our scientific committee</li>
