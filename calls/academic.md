<h2 id="intro">Academic Track</h2>

This year's State of the Map conference will again feature a full day Academic Track session. Following on from the great success of the inaugural Academic Track session at SotM&nbsp;<span class="numeral">2018</span>, this session will showcase both the ongoing innovation and maturity of scientific investigations and research into OpenStreetMap. Building upon the motto of SotM&nbsp;<span class="numeral">2019</span> in "Bridging the Map" the Academic Track session will provide the bridge to join together the experience, understanding, ideas, concepts and skills from different groups of researchers, academics and scientists from around the world. In particular, the Academic Track session will provide a bridge to connect members of the OpenStreetMap community and the academic community by providing a open passage for exchange of ideas, communication and opportunities for increased collaboration. We expect empirical, methodological, conceptual, or literature-review-based contributions addressing any scientific aspect related to OpenStreetMap, in particular, but not limited, to the following:

  * OpenStreetMap extrinsic and intrinsic quality assessment
  * Analysis of contribution patterns in OpenStreetMap
  * Integration and/or conflation of OSM data to generate new and scientifically valuable datasets
  * Assessments of data import procedures and their impacts on data and community
  * Data interplay between OpenStreetMap and other data sources (authoritative or user-generated)
  * Analysis/comparison of available software for scientific purposes related to OSM
  * New approaches to facilitate or improve data collection in OpenStreetMap (e.g. through gamification or Citizen Science approaches)
  * Bridging the communities: creating better connections and collaborations between the scientific community and the OpenStreetMap community
  * Open research problems in OpenStreetMap and challenges for the scientific community
  * Cultural, political, and organizational aspects of data production and usage practices in OpenStreetMap

<h2 id="guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>

Authors are invited to submit abstracts using the State of the Map&nbsp;<span class="numeral">2019</span> _Pretalx_ [submission system](https://pretalx.com/sotm2019-at/cfp). <del>Deadline for submission is May&nbsp;<span class="numeral">10</span>, <span class="numeral">2019</span>.</del> <span style="font-weight: bold">Deadline extended to May&nbsp;<span class="numeral">19</span>, <span class="numeral">2019</span>.</span>

Abstracts should include from a minimum of 500 to a maximum of 800 words.These limits will be strictly enforced for a fair and balanced review process.

Abstracts must be scientifically rigorous and the content should be structured as follows: introduction/background, where the problem addressed is introduced; main aim or purpose of the study; brief description of the methodology and findings achieved; final discussion highlighting the scientific contribution of the study and its practical benefits/implications. Abstract authors are free to organise their abstracts into appropriate sections or parts. The above structure is provided as a suggestion only.

There are no specific formatting or layout guidelines as the abstract will be submitted online in plain-text format.

Abstracts will be evaluated by the Scientific Committee. Authors of selected abstracts will be invited to give an oral presentation during the Academic Track sessions at the conference. The selected abstracts will be published as a collection with a distinct Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in an open access online repository (e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).  

The scientific committee will seek to further disseminate the contributions made to the Academic Track by organizing a Special Issue in a relevant, open access, scientific journal (e.g. [ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi) or [Open Geospatial Data, Software and Standards](https://opengeospatialdata.springeropen.com/)). Authors of the selected abstracts will be invited to submit a full paper to this Special Issue. Successful submissions will enjoy partial or full waiver of publication fees.
